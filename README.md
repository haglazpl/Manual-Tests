## General info
Manual tests created for recruitment purposes, created by Dominik Majchrzak.

There was no specification provided, so I was left with two choices:
    1. Report back that correct testing is impossible without documentation, because 
        how can I test something if I don't know how it should work?
    2. Act like Product Owner and create simple requirements and test accordingly.

I went with choice nr. 2 and this is the result

Each task is assigned to a folder Zadanie 1/2/3/4

Requirements for task 1/2 is located in folder Zadanie 1, file name is ATMS_Chrono_login_requirements.pdf
Task 1 is completed in file, Zadanie manual 1 - QA.pdf
